# BlogActua is a repository used for stroring project files of a personal website.
Syncing is always done with Visual Studio Code.

For hosting the probable service is https://easyhost.be/nl

Soon a rename of the repository will be done to something more personal, if not possible the files will be moved to a new repository and this one will be deleted.
